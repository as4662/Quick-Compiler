# Quick-Compiler
A Java compiler is a software tool that translates Java source code into machine-executable
bytecode. The compilation process typically consists of several phases that are performed
sequentially. The first phase is lexical analysis, which involves breaking the source code into
tokens. The second phase is syntax analysis, where the compiler checks the program's
structure and creates a syntax tree. The third phase is semantic analysis, where the compiler
checks the program's meaning, including type checking and scope rules. The fourth phase is
intermediate code generation, where the syntax tree is transformed into an intermediate
representation. The fifth phase is code optimization, which applies various optimization
techniques to the intermediate code to improve efficiency. The sixth phase is code
generation, where the final machine code is produced. Throughout the compilation process,
a symbol table is maintained to store information about the program's symbols.
